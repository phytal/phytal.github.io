title: Memory to AGI
---
LLMs are already *smart* enough. We’re standing at the cusp of AGI. The missing link isn't more intelligence. It's memory.
Not recall, not storage, but memory that evolves, reasons, and improves itself just like the human brain.

The alternative of having an external memory layer is reinforcement learning: expensive, time consuming, and opaque. We need something better — a persistent, interpretable memory layer that lets agents learn continuously.

And after we build it, the next frontier is sharing.
A network where agents exchange what they’ve learned, avoiding relearning and accelerating understanding.

Nebula is pioneering the memory infrastructure needed to take AI from *stateless slop* to *continuous improvement*. 
We’re architecting the best multimodal memory framework, followed by defining a universal memory protocol, then enabling the exchange of information between both virtual and physical autonomous agents.
